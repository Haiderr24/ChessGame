# Chess Game -
This is a Java-based Chess game implemented using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows two players to play chess with standard rules and move validation. It features a dynamic board and pieces, move validation, and check/checkmate detection.

# Features -
- Graphical Chessboard**: Built using Java Swing.
- Move Validation**: Ensures only legal moves are made.
- Check & Checkmate Detection**: Alerts when a player is in check or checkmate.
- Piece-Specific Movement**: Each chess piece moves according to standard rules.
- Turn-based Play**: Enforces alternating turns between players.

# How It Works -
The game initializes a standard chessboard with all pieces set in their correct starting positions. Each player takes turns selecting and moving pieces according to chess rules. The system enforces valid moves and will not allow illegal ones. If a move puts the opponentâ€™s king in check or checkmate, the game notifies the players. The game can be exited by closing the window.

# About the Project -
This project was created to provide an interactive and visual representation of a Chess game using Java. The implementation follows object-oriented programming principles, making it modular and extensible. Each piece has its own class defining its movement logic, and the board manages interactions between pieces. The GUI enhances the user experience by visually representing moves and board state updates in real-time.
